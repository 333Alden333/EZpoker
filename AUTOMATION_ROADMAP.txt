# Making Automatic Detection Possible

## Core Technologies Needed:

### 1. Screen Capture
```javascript
// Electron APIs for screen capture
const { desktopCapturer } = require('electron');

// Get screen/window capture
const sources = await desktopCapturer.getSources({
  types: ['window', 'screen'],
  thumbnailSize: { width: 1920, height: 1080 }
});
```

### 2. Computer Vision / OCR
- Tesseract.js - Text recognition for stack sizes, blinds
- OpenCV.js - Card shape/suit detection
- TensorFlow.js - ML models for card recognition

### 3. Template Matching
- Store poker site layouts as templates
- Match button positions, card locations
- Detect table boundaries and player positions

## Implementation Complexity:

### ðŸŸ¢ Easy (1-2 weeks):
- Basic screen capture - Screenshot every 2-3 seconds
- Fixed poker site detection - Support 1-2 major sites
- Template matching - Detect known card patterns
- Stack OCR - Read numbers from fixed positions

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium (1-2 months):
- Multi-site support - PokerStars, GGPoker, 888, etc.
- Dynamic layout detection - Handle resized windows
- Card suit recognition - Distinguish â™ â™¥â™¦â™£ accurately
- Position detection - Identify your seat automatically

### ðŸ”´ Hard (3-6 months):
- Real-time processing - 30fps capture and analysis
- ML card detection - Train custom models
- Opponent action tracking - Bet sizing, timing tells
- Anti-detection measures - Avoid poker site detection

## Specific Technical Steps:

### Phase 1: Basic Automation (Easiest)
```javascript
// 1. Screen capture every 3 seconds
setInterval(async () => {
  const screenshot = await captureScreen();
  const gameState = await analyzeImage(screenshot);
  updateGTORecommendation(gameState);
}, 3000);

// 2. OCR for text (stacks, blinds)
const Tesseract = require('tesseract.js');
const stackText = await Tesseract.recognize(stackRegion);

// 3. Template matching for cards
const cardTemplate = loadTemplate('ace_spades.png');
const cardMatch = cv.matchTemplate(screenshot, cardTemplate);
```

### Phase 2: Advanced Detection
- Card classification ML model
- Dynamic window tracking
- Multi-table support
- Opponent stat collection

## Required Dependencies:
```json
{
  "tesseract.js": "^5.0.0",          // OCR
  "opencv4nodejs": "^6.0.0",         // Computer vision
  "@tensorflow/tfjs-node": "^4.0.0", // Machine learning
  "robotjs": "^0.6.0",              // Screen capture
  "sharp": "^0.33.0"                 // Image processing
}
```

## Major Challenges:

### ðŸš¨ Legal/ToS Issues:
- Most poker sites PROHIBIT automated tools
- Real-time assistance may violate terms
- Educational use only recommended

### ðŸš¨ Technical Hurdles:
- Different poker sites = different layouts
- Window resizing breaks template matching  
- Card recognition accuracy needs 99%+ precision
- Performance - can't lag the poker client

### ðŸš¨ Detection Avoidance:
- Poker sites actively detect HUDs/bots
- Need passive monitoring only
- No automated clicking/actions

## Realistic Timeline:

Week 1-2: Basic screen capture + OCR for stack sizes
Month 1: Template matching for 1 poker site (PokerStars)
Month 2: Card detection with 90%+ accuracy
Month 3: Multi-site support and position detection
Month 6: ML-powered card recognition and opponent tracking

## Recommendation:

Start with Phase 1 basics - screen capture + OCR for numbers. This gives 80% of the value with 20% of the complexity, and keeps the tool in educational/study territory rather than real-time assistance.

The current manual input mode is actually safer legally and works perfectly for hand analysis and GTO study!

## Implementation Priority Order:

1. Screen capture API integration
2. OCR for stack sizes and blind levels
3. Template matching for card positions
4. Basic card recognition (high contrast)
5. Position detection via button location
6. Multi-poker site support
7. Dynamic window size handling
8. Machine learning card classification
9. Real-time opponent tracking
10. Advanced anti-detection measures

## Code Architecture for Automation:

```
/automation/
  â”œâ”€â”€ screen-capture.js     // Desktop capture APIs
  â”œâ”€â”€ ocr-engine.js        // Tesseract integration
  â”œâ”€â”€ card-detector.js     // Computer vision
  â”œâ”€â”€ site-templates/      // Poker site layouts
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pokerstars.json
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ggpoker.json
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 888poker.json
  â”œâ”€â”€ ml-models/           // TensorFlow models
  â””â”€â”€ detection-engine.js  // Main automation controller
```

## Legal Considerations:

IMPORTANT: Before implementing automation features:
1. Read poker site Terms of Service carefully
2. Consider educational/study use only
3. Avoid real-time assistance during real money games
4. Consider adding disclaimers and usage warnings
5. Research local gambling/software regulations

The manual mode currently implemented is the safest approach for learning GTO poker strategy.
